## Important Things to Remember
1) Bitwise operation for finding 2^h is **1<<h**.

2) For a complete binary tree, time complexity for any traversal (inorder, preorder...) is **0(N)**. Since, the max height(h) of a complete binary tree is logN, auxiliary space complexity is **O(logN)**.


## Important Questions

1) [Vertical Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/description/)
   - Data structures: priority_queue and unordered_map

2) [Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/description/)
   - This question is simple but requires handling of integer overflow.
    Revise to go over over-flow handling.

3) [Amount of time for BT to be infected](https://leetcode.com/problems/amount-of-time-for-binary-tree-to-be-infected/description/)

4) [Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)
   - Good question to revise recursion in BTs

5) [BT to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)
   - Revise all 3 methods as mentioned in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWf7k1x9XR4&list=PLkjdNRgDmcc0Pom5erUBU4ZayeU9AyRRu&index=38)
